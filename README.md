## Retrospective

This was my first time putting together a fully-fledged, multi-page website and, overall, I believe it went very well!
I've learnt a lot from this process and, certainly, would do some things differently should I attempt it again. For instance, I believe my SASS could have been cleaner with a little more pre-planning and less trying to force each webpage to conform to a singular model.
One thing I found really useful to learn about, however, was pulling data from a JSON file to populate each page. It keeps my files much more organised and provides a more interactive experience.
